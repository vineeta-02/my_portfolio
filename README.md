Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my education, skills, and hobbies, as I pursue my journey in Computer Science Engineering. It has been built entirely using frontend development technologies, focusing on simplicity, responsiveness, and a clean user experience.

## Features:

#### Education Section: 
A detailed breakdown of my academic background, including my Bachelors degree of technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

#### Skills Section: 
A list of my technical skills, with proficiency in various programming languages, tools, and frameworks.

#### Contact: 
Easy-to-use contact information for professional inquiries.

## Tech Stack:
##### HTML5: 
For structuring the website.
##### CSS3: 
For styling and responsive design.
##### JavaScript: 
For adding interactivity and functionality.

This website is a simple frontend project, and Iâ€™m looking for ways to enhance and improve my skills to make a well developed portfolio other than this. 
Feel free to explore the code if you are a beginner and get in touch with any feedback!
